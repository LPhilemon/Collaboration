## Make it So

This is a sample Android app that demonstrates how to use Firebase Authentication, Crashlytics, 
Cloud Firestore and Hilt with Jetpack Compose UI. Make it So is a simple to-do list application
that allows the user to add and edit to-do items, add flags, priorities, due dates, and mark the tasks as completed.

To explain how each product above was used in the code, we've written a series of articles that delve into creating this app from scratch. 
[Part 1](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/04/building-an-app-android-jetpack-compose-firebase)
of this series has an overview of what you can do with this app and how it is structured. 
[Part 2](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/05/adding-firebase-auth-to-jetpack-compose-app) 
shows how to implement login and sign up flows using Firebase Authentication. 
[Part 3](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/06/adding-crashlytics-to-jetpack-compose-app) 
covers how to add Firebase Crashlytics to handle crashes and display messages to the user. 
[Part 4](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/07/adding-cloud-firestore-to-jetpack-compose-app) 
is all about Cloud Firestore: it covers how to listen to changes on the stored items and update the UI based on these events.
